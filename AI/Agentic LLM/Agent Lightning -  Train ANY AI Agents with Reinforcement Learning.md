## Introduction

Agent Lightning addresses a critical challenge in AI agent development: how to continuously improve Large Language Model (LLM) agents through reinforcement learning without requiring major code modifications. The framework introduces a unified approach that decouples agent execution from RL training, enabling any existing agent to benefit from adaptive learning with minimal integration effort.

![Agent Lightning Architecture](https://paper-assets.alphaxiv.org/figures/2508.03680v1/agent_lightning_architecture_v3.png "Agent Lightning Architecture") _Figure 1: Agent Lightning's Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture separates RL training (server) from agent execution (client), allowing seamless integration with diverse agent frameworks through a standardized API._

While LLMs have enabled sophisticated AI agents capable of complex tasks like search, code generation, and tool usage, these agents remain prone to errors, particularly in unfamiliar domains or when handling private datasets. Traditional approaches to agent optimization face significant barriers:<span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)"> existing RL frameworks are designed for single-turn interactions, while agents involve multi-turn dialogues, tool interactions, and complex orchestration logic. Agent Lightning resolves this fundamental mismatch by providing a framework that can optimize any agent regardless of its underlying implementation.</span>

## Unified Data Interface and MDP Formulation

<span style="background:#fff88f">Agent Lightning's core innovation lies in modeling agent execution as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), creating a unified data interface that abstracts away agent-specific implementation details.</span> This formulation treats each agent interaction systematically:

- **State (S)**: Represents the agent's execution snapshot through "semantic variables" (e.g., user input, retrieved documents, generated responses) that capture the program's intent
- **Action (A)**: Corresponds to the complete token sequence generated from a single LLM invocation, <span style="background:#fff88f"><span style="background:#fff88f">treating the entire output as one at</span>omic action</span>
- **Observation (O)**: <span style="background:#fff88f">The input context provided to the LLM at each step</span>, derived from the current state
- **Reward (R)**: <span style="background:#fff88f">Scalar feedback signals evaluating action quality</span>, including both intermediate rewards (successful tool calls) and terminal rewards (overall task completion)

<span style="background:#fff88f">This MDP abstraction enables agent trajectories to be represented as standardized sequences of transitions</span>: `(input_t, output_t, reward_t)`. This format is agnostic to the underlying agent framework, whether built with LangChain, AutoGen, OpenAI Agents SDK, or custom implementations. <span style="background:rgba(240, 107, 5, 0.2)">Unlike previous approaches that concatenate all agent turns into single sequences, this transition-based representation avoids issues with context length accumulation and complex masking strategies.</span>

## LightningRL: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning

To optimize agents using the collected transitions, Agent Lightning introduces LightningRL, a hierarchical RL algorithm specifically designed for multi-turn agent scenarios. <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">The algorithm addresses the key challenge of credit assignment in episodic agent interactions:</span>

**Credit Assignment**: LightningRL decomposes episode-level returns across individual LLM actions. <span style="background:#fff88f">In its current implementation, it uses identical assignment, where each action within an episode receives the same reward equal to the final return</span>:

$$
R_t = R \quad \text{for all } t \text{ in episode}
$$

**Integration with Existing RL Methods**: After credit assignment, each transition `(input_t, output_t, reward_t)` is treated as an independent <span style="background:#fff88f">single-turn interaction, allowing seamless integration with established RL algorithms like GRPO, PPO, and REINFORCE++</span>. For methods requiring advantage estimation, transitions from the same task are grouped appropriately.

The algorithm comparison shows Agent Lightning's advantages over traditional approaches:

<span style="background:rgba(240, 107, 5, 0.2)">This approach offers several benefits over masking-based methods:</span>

- **Flexible Context Construction**: Input contexts can be dynamically constructed from current state information rather than requiring full trajectory concatenation
- **Scalability**: Avoids excessive context lengths that can exceed LLM input limits
- **Selective Optimization**: Enables training specific agents or roles within multi-agent systems by including only relevant transitions

## Training-Agent Disaggregation Architecture

Agent Lightning implements a Training-Agent Disaggregation (TA Disaggregation) architecture that completely <span style="background:#fff88f">separates RL training infrastructure from agent execution logic. This design enables the framework's key promise of requiring "almost ZERO code modifications" for existing agents.</span>

![System Process](https://paper-assets.alphaxiv.org/figures/2508.03680v1/agent_lightning_process.png "System Process") _Figure 3: Complete system workflow showing the interaction between RL framework, Agent Lightning server/client, and agent execution with automatic data capture and model updates._

**Lightning Server**: Functions as the training controller, managing RL optimization, task orchestration, and model serving. It exposes an OpenAI-compatible API that updated models can be accessed through, making integration transparent to existing agent code.

**Lightning Client**: Serves as the agent runtime environment with several key capabilities:

- **Data Parallelism**: Efficiently manages concurrent execution of multiple agent instances across nodes to process large batch sizes
- **Transparent Data Capture**: Uses instrumentation techniques like OpenTelemetry or built-in tracing to capture LLM calls and execution traces without code modification
- **Automatic Intermediate Rewarding (AIR)**: Converts system monitoring data (tool call success/failure, execution status) into intermediate reward signals, addressing the sparse reward problem in RL
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive mechanisms for managing agent crashes, network issues, and invalid outputs to ensure training stability

This architecture allows the compute-intensive RL training to run independently from diverse agent applications, each potentially using different frameworks and requiring different resources.

## Experimental Validation and Results

Agent Lightning's effectiveness is demonstrated across three challenging tasks, each using a different prominent agent framework to showcase the system's versatility:

**Text-to-SQL with LangChain**: A complex multi-agent system on the Spider dataset involving SQL generation, verification, and refinement agents. The framework successfully optimized multiple agents simultaneously while leaving others unchanged.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation with OpenAI Agents SDK**: Multi-hop question answering on the MuSiQue dataset using the entire Wikipedia as a knowledge base. The agent must generate appropriate search queries and synthesize information across multiple retrieved documents.

**Math QA with Tool Usage via AutoGen**: Arithmetic problem solving using a calculator tool on the Calc-X dataset, requiring precise tool invocation and result interpretation.

![Data Interface Example](https://paper-assets.alphaxiv.org/figures/2508.03680v1/data_interface.png "Data Interface Example") _Figure 4: Example of how Agent Lightning converts RAG agent execution into structured transitions for RL training, showing state evolution and data extraction process._

Across all three scenarios, the results consistently demonstrate stable, continuous performance improvement:

- **Calculator Task**: Test rewards improved from 0.06 to 0.77, showing dramatic enhancement in mathematical reasoning and tool usage
- **MuSiQue RAG**: Test performance increased from 0.01 to 0.23, demonstrating improved multi-hop reasoning capabilities
- **Spider SQL**: Test rewards improved from 0.15 to 0.56, indicating better SQL generation and database querying skills

The training curves show stable convergence without the instability often associated with RL training, validating both the algorithmic design and system robustness.

## Framework Architecture and Implementation

Agent Lightning's implementation demonstrates sophisticated system design principles. The unified data interface transforms diverse agent executions into a common format that RL algorithms can process effectively. The MDP formulation captures the essential semantics of agent interactions while abstracting away framework-specific details.

![System Overview](https://paper-assets.alphaxiv.org/figures/2508.03680v1/overview.png "System Overview") _Figure 5: High-level overview of Agent Lightning's continuous learning cycle, from agent execution and data collection to RL training and model updates._

The hierarchical approach of LightningRL addresses the fundamental challenge of applying single-turn RL methods to multi-turn agent scenarios. By decomposing episode rewards across individual transitions and then treating each as an independent training example, the framework bridges the gap between agent complexity and RL algorithm requirements.

The disaggregation architecture represents a significant engineering achievement, enabling scalable, fault-tolerant training of diverse agents. The client-server separation allows training infrastructure to be optimized independently from agent applications, while the OpenAI-compatible API ensures compatibility with existing codebases.

## Significance and Impact

Agent Lightning represents a substantial advancement in AI agent development by solving the fundamental challenge of applying RL to real-world agents. The framework's ability to work with any existing agent with minimal code changes democratizes access to advanced RL-based optimization techniques.

The unified data interface and hierarchical RL approach establish new patterns for handling multi-turn, tool-augmented AI interactions. By treating agent execution as structured transitions rather than monolithic sequences, the framework enables more flexible and scalable training paradigms.

The disaggregated architecture provides a template for building robust, production-ready AI training systems. The separation of concerns between training infrastructure and agent applications allows both to evolve independently while maintaining compatibility.

Most importantly, Agent Lightning enables the vision of continuously learning AI agents that can adapt and improve in deployment. By leveraging the rich interaction data generated during real-world usage, agents can move beyond static pre-training to dynamic optimization based on actual performance in their intended environments.

The framework's validation across diverse tasks and frameworks demonstrates its general applicability, suggesting it could accelerate the development and deployment of more capable, reliable AI agents across numerous domains and applications.
